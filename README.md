# Makers Process Reviews

This is a repository for my process reviews. Each review folder contains the task, the code and the feedback. Please note that I aimed to complete the code post-review for practice purposes.

## What are reviews? (by Makers) 

The most important part of our work at Makers is to help you get a job. And reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They’re an hour long, giving you a great read on how you’re working.

Reviews will give you extensive written feedback on your process and how you tackle programming problems.

## What happens during a review?

The review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The review assesses how well a developer:

* Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
* Writes good tests,
* Writes clean code,
* Debugs when things go wrong,
* Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.
